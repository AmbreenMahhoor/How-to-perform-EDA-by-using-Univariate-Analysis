Univariate Analysis in EDA: Main and Core Uses with Suitable Data Types

**1. Summarizing Data:**

   - Main Use: Provides a summary of the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a single variable's distribution.
   - Suitable Data Types: 
     - **Numerical Data**: Continuous or discrete numbers (e.g., age, income, temperature).
     - **Categorical Data**: Categories or labels (e.g., gender, product category).

**2. Detecting Outliers:**

   - **Main Use**: Identifies unusual or extreme values that differ significantly from other observations.
   - **Suitable Data Types**: 
     - **Numerical Data**: Continuous or discrete numbers where outliers can significantly impact analysis.

**3. Understanding Data Distribution:**
   - **Main Use**: Examines the frequency and pattern of data points within a single variable.
   - **Suitable Data Types**: 
     - **Numerical Data**: Continuous or discrete numbers to determine distribution shape (e.g., normal, skewed).
     - **Categorical Data**: Categories or labels to understand frequency distribution.

**4. Identifying Data Quality Issues:**
   - **Main Use**: Checks for missing values, data entry errors, and inconsistencies.
   - **Suitable Data Types**: 
     - **Numerical Data**: Continuous or discrete numbers to identify missing or inconsistent entries.
     - **Categorical Data**: Categories or labels to detect missing or incorrect categories.

**5. Visualizing Data:**
   - **Main Use**: Creates visual representations to represent the distribution of a single variable.
   - **Suitable Data Types**: 
     - **Numerical Data**: Continuous or discrete numbers visualized with histograms, box plots, density plots.
     - **Categorical Data**: Categories or labels visualized with bar charts, pie charts.
     - **Ordinal Data**: Ranked categories visualized to highlight order (e.g., customer satisfaction ratings).

 Conclusion

Univariate analysis is essential in EDA for understanding the properties of a single variable, detecting outliers, identifying data quality issues, and summarizing and visualizing data. This type of analysis is suitable for:

- **Numerical Data**: For summarizing distributions, detecting outliers, and visualizing data.
- **Categorical Data**: For understanding frequency distributions and ensuring data quality.
- **Ordinal Data**: For examining the distribution and order of ranked data.
